Today, let's get a little creative and develop a ranking system where we can sort points and calculate the position of an individual or a team competing in a game/competition.

Note:
If two or more persons have the same number of points, they should have same position number and sorted by name (name is unique).

For example, Input structure:

[
  {
    name: "John",
    points: 100,
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    points: 130,
  },
  {
    name: "Mary",
    points: 120,
  },
  {
    name: "Kate",
    points: 120,
  },
]
Output should be:

[
  {
    name: "Bob",
    points: 130,
    position: 1,
  },
  {
    name: "Kate",
    points: 120,
    position: 2,
  },
  {
    name: "Mary",
    points: 120,
    position: 2,
  },
  {
    name: "John",
    points: 100,
    position: 4,
  },
]
Good luck!
