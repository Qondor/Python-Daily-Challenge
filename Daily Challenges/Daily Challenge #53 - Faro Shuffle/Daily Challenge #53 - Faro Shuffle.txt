To faro shuffle a deck of playing cards is to split the deck exactly in half, then perfectly interweave the cards, such that the original top and bottom cards are unchanged.

Write a function that accepts a even-numbered list and faro shuffles the indices.

Example
Faro shuffling the list: ['ace', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
will give ['ace', 'four', 'two', 'five', 'three', 'six']
