Today's challenge requires you to calculate one's running pace.

For example:

runningPace(distance, time)
distance - A float with the number of kilometres
time - A string containing the time it took to travel the distance; it will always be minutes:seconds

The function should return the pace, "5:20" means it took 5 minutes and 20 seconds to travel one kilometre.

Happy Coding!
