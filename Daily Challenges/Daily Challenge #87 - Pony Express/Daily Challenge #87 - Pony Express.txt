The Pony Express was a mail service that operated from 1859-60 in the United States. It was made completely obsolete by the intercontinental telegraph.

There were a number of stations where a rider would stop to switch to a fresh horse, or pass the mail bag along to another rider to continue the trek.

stations is an array/list of distances in miles from one station to the next along the route.

Implement a riders function, to return how many riders it would take to get from point A to point B. Riders will never agree to riding more than 100 miles.

example: stations = [43, 23, 40, 13]
output: 2 riders

Good luck!
