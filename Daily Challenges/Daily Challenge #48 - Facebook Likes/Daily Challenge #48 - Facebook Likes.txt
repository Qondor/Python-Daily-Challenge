In today's challenge, you are asked to create a like system from Facebook; a text which displays the names of people who liked an item.

For example:

likes [] must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.
