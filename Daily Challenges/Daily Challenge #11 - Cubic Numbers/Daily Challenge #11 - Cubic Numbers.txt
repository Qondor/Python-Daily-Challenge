The first part of this challenge is to create a method that can determine whether a number is a cubic number or not. If the number has been determined to not be cubic, the output should be either null or the string "Unlucky."

Cubic numbers are numbers with at most three digits, such that the sum of the cubes of their digits is the number itself.

For example: 153 is a cubic number, because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

In this challenge, we’ll be looking at a modified version of g964’s “Hidden ‘Cubic’ Numbers” kata on CodeWars. Thank you to CodeWars, who has licensed redistribution of this challenge under the 2-Clause BSD License!
