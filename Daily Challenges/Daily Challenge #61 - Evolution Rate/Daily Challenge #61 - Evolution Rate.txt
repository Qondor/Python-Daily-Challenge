Write a function getEvolutionRateMessage which takes two numbers before & after. The before value is the initial value of the evolution. The after value is the value after its evolution. An evolution can be calculated as follows:

evolution = (after - before) / before * 100

This function will return a string such that there are three possible outputs:
"A positive evolution of X%."
"A negative evolution of Y%."
"No evolution."

Examples:

getEvolutionRateMessage 11.29 45.79
getEvolutionRateMessage 95.12 66.84
getEvolutionRateMessage 0 27.35
getEvolutionRateMessage 41.26 0
getEvolutionRateMessage 1.26 1.26

"A positive evolution of 306%."
"A negative evolution of 30%."
"A positive evolution of 2735%."
"A negative evolution of 4126%."
"No evolution."
