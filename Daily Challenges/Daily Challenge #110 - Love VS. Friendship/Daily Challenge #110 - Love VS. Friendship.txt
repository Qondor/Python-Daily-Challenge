Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

Write a function to find the "strength" of each of these values.

Test cases:
wordsToMarks(attitude)
wordsToMarks(friends)
wordsToMarks(family)
wordsToMarks(selflessness)
wordsToMarks(knowledge)

Good luck!
