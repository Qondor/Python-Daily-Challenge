In this challenge, you'll be given an array with a length of at least three, containing (possibly quite large) integers. The array is either comprised of entirely odd integers or even integers with one exception. Write a method that returns the integer that is not like the others.

Example:
findOutlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]) => 11

Additional practice arrays:
[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
[4, 8, 15, 16, 24, 42]
[16, 6, 40, 66, 68, 28]

Good luck, happy coding~!
