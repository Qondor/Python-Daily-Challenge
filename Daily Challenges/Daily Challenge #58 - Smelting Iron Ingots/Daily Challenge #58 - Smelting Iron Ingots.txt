Minecraft has gotten to be a very popular game. No doubt many reading this have played it themselves or watched someone else. In Minecraft, collected ore must be smelted in a furnace to change the resource into a usable form.

Each ingot takes 11 seconds to produce. Steve has the following fuel options to add to the furnace:

Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds
Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds
Coals, each lasts 80 seconds
Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds
Sticks, each lasts 1 second*

Write a function that calculates the minimum amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots.

Ruby: {:lava => 2, :blaze_rod => 1, :coal => 1, :wood => 0, :stick => 0}
JavaScript: {lava: 2, blazeRod: 1, coal: 1, wood: 0, stick: 0}

Good luck!~
