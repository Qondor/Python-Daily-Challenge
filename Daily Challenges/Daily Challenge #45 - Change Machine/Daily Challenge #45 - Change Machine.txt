Today's challenge is to implement a change function that will accept an integer parameter that represents cents. The function should return the optimal change using the least number of coins.

The function should also return a key for each coin of US currency (specifically 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢ coins). The value of each coin should represent the count of each coin in the change. The value for each coin that is not included should return 0.

Ex.
change(31)
{ 25 => 1, 10 => 0, 5 => 1, 1 => 1 }

Good luck!
