Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code. They often employ natural sounds as cover. Our ninja will chirp like a bird, with different amounts of chirps signifying different messages.

chirp(4);
    //output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.

Consider String.prototype.repeat,String.prototype.padStart, and String.prototype.padEnd disabled for this challenge, you'll have to think recursively to avoid detection.

Good luck!
