For this challenge, write a function that encrypts phone numbers. The method should hide the last six digits of each phone number.

Example 1 (Using US phone number)
IN: 201-680-0202 => OUT: 201-6XX-XXXX

You can also have the code check the validity of the phone number's format.

Example 2
IN: 145-201-680-0202 => OUT: false

Feel free to apply this challenge to phone numbers outside the USA as well.

Good luck!
