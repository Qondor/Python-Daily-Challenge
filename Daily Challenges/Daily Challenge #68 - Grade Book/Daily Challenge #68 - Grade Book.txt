Today's challenge is to write a function that accepts three integer values, calculates the mean, then returns the letter value associated with that grade. If the mean of those three integers ends in a number greater than five, append a plus sign to the letter grade. If it is less than five, append a minus sign.

Numerical Score      Letter Grade
90 <= score <= 100    'A'
80 <= score < 90      'B'
70 <= score < 80      'C'
60 <= score < 70      'D'
 0 <= score < 60      'F'
Examples:
grade(64, 55, 92) => C- (70.3)
grade(99, 89, 93) => A- (93.6)
grade(33, 99, 95) => C+ (75.6)

Happy coding!
